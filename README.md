## Overview

The SMS Classifier project is aimed at developing a machine learning model to classify SMS (Short Message Service) messages into two categories: spam and ham (non-spam). With the ever-increasing volume of text messages being sent globally, distinguishing between legitimate messages and unwanted spam messages has become essential. By leveraging data science techniques, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning algorithms, this project provides a solution to automatically classify incoming SMS messages, thereby improving user experience and security.

## Dependencies

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x: You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Required Python Libraries


- NumPy: For numerical operations.
-TensorFlow:For standard mathematical operations or tensors.
- Matplotlib: For data visualization.


## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the code and obtain SMS Classifier using Data Science

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sameera0103/SMS-Classifier.git  
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd SMS Classifier 
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Install the required Python libraries as mentioned in the "Dependencies" section.

4. **Data Preparation:**

   We loaded MNIST dataset from keras and preprocessed them.

5. **Configure Parameters:**

   Open the `config.py` file and set the required parameters, such as batch size,epoch for training GAN.

6. **Run the Code:**

   Execute the main script to analyze Generative Model for Data Augmentation using GAN .

   ```bash
   python SMS Classification.py
   ```

   The script will perform data preprocessing, generate synthetic data and produce augment data.

7. **View Results:**

   The results and visualizations will be saved in the `output` folder. You can explore them to gain insights into SMS Classification.
## Configuration

You can customize the behavior of the code by modifying the parameters in the `config.py` file. Some of the key configurations include:

- `DATA_FILE`: Path to the input transaction data file.
- `OUTPUT_DIR`: Path to the output directory where results will be saved.
- Other parameters related to visualization and data preprocessing.

## Results

The code will generate various insights and visualizations, including:

-Generates synthetic data that closely mimics original data.
- Improved Generalization.
- Enhance model robustness
- Visualizations of original data,synthetic data and augmented data.
