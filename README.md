This project is designed to analyse between the spam and the ham messages
Overview
The SMS Classifier project is aimed at developing a machine learning model to classify SMS (Short Message Service) messages into two categories: spam and ham (non-spam). With the ever-increasing volume of text messages being sent globally, distinguishing between legitimate messages and unwanted spam messages has become essential. By leveraging data science techniques, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning algorithms, this project provides a solution to automatically classify incoming SMS messages, thereby improving user experience and security.

Dependencies
Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x: You can download and install Python from python.org.
You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Required Python Libraries
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.
Seaborn: For enhancing data visualization.
Apriori Algorithm: For association rule mining.
Getting Started
Follow these steps to run the code and obtain market basket insights:

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-Sameera0103/SMS-Classifier.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:

cd sms-classifier
Install Dependencies:

Install the required Python libraries as mentioned in the "Dependencies" section.

Data Preparation:

Place your sma classifier data in the data folder. The data should be in a CSV format, with columns like label and text.

Configure Parameters:

Open the config.py file and set the required parameters, such as support and confidence thresholds for association rule mining.

Run the Code:

Execute the main script to analyze the sms classifier data.

python SMS_Classifier.pynb
The script will perform data preprocessing,Visualization, generate models like SVM and naive bayesian

View Results:

The results and visualizations will be saved in the output folder. You can explore them to gain insights into sms classifier.

Configuration
You can customize the behavior of the code by modifying the parameters in the config.py file. Some of the key configurations include:

DATA_FILE: Path to the input data file.
OUTPUT_DIR: Path to the output directory where results will be saved.

Other parameters related to visualization and data preprocessing.
Results
The code will generate various insights and visualizations, including:
Visualizations of spam and a non-spam messages.
Acknowledgments
This project is based on the principles of seggregating the spam and the non-spam messages. The code uses open-source libraries and is intended for educational and practical use.

Dataset Source
The dataset used in this project is the "Spam" dataset, which can be obtained from the Kaggle at the following URL: SMS Classifier. This dataset contains the most frequent messages that are sent to the people those are marked as spam with the indication label.

Dataset Description:

V1:Indicates Spam or ham 
V2: Indicates the text message
Dependencies
Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x: You can download and install Python from python.org.
